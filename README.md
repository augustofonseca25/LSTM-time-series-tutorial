## Understanding Household Energy Consumption: A Deep Learning Approach 



This tutorial will guide you on how to apply sequence modeling techniques to analyze and predict household electric power consumption. We used the "Individual Household Electric Power Consumption" [dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption), which includes diverse measures of electricity usage in a household over four years. The tutorial focus on employing Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to understand patterns in energy usage and forecast future consumption. We implemented this project in Python using TensorFlow and Keras, presented as an interactive Jupyter Notebook.
